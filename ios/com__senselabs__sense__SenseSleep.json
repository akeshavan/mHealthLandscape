By monitoring your heart rate while guiding you through simple breathing exercises, SenseSleep is designed to lower your heart rate, calm your brainwaves, and prepare your body for rest. Our neuroscientists have designed controlled breathing exercises to help your brain easily enter a more relaxed, sleepy state.\n\nNOTE: When measuring heart rate, your index finger needs to completely cover both the camera lens and the flash. Hold your finger securely in place with a moderate amount of pressure, a tight grip may lead to inaccurate readings. Using SenseSleep while in motion or when your fingers are too cold may lead to inaccurate readings. This app is intended for recreational use and is not intended to treat, cure, or diagnose any medical condition.\n\nHere\u2019s to a great night's sleep,\u2028\u2028\n\nThe SenseLabs Team", "artistId": 1018931529, "artistName": "SenseLabs", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Education"], "price": 0.0, "currency": "USD", "bundleId": "com.senselabs.sense.SenseSleep", "releaseDate": "2016-01-05T18:04:26Z", "averageUserRating": 5.0, "userRatingCount": 23}
