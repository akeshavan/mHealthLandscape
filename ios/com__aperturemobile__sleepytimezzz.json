It\u2019s the alarm app that will change your mornings forever!\n\nSleep Time is an app that cares about your sleep. Here are its main features:\n\n\u2022\t Reminds you go to bed on time by letting you set bedtime reminders. \n\u2022\t Wakes you up when you\u2019re in your lightest sleep state so you could feel rested & relaxed. \n\u2022 \tMotivates you to get out of bed with a motivational or inspirational quote after you stop the alarm. Start your day with a positive spirit.\n\u2022\t Features a sleep cycle calculator, which can help you find the best wake up times for a given bedtime or the best bedtimes for a given wake-up time. It takes into account the time you need to fall asleep (sleep latency), which can be changed in settings.\n\nLet\u2019s assume you\u2019re going to bed right now. Wouldn\u2019t you want to know what are the best times for you to wake up? Or let\u2019s assume you\u2019re a student studying for an exam late at night, all you know you have to be up at 7 in the morning, wouldn\u2019t you want to know what are the best times for you to go to bed so you could cram as much as possible for the exam while still waking up refreshed? \n\nYou can set an alarm to wake you up at any time you desire. That alarm will wake you up within a wake-up window you specify. For example, if you set an alarm at 8 with a wake-up phase of 30 minutes, you\u2019ll wake up between 7:30 and 8. Sleep Time will use your device\u2019s accelerometer to detect your movements in bed. Based on your movements, Sleep Time will know when you\u2019re in a light sleep state, and then ring the alarm. The result is, a fresher, happier, and awesome you! \n\nFEATURES:\n-------------------\n\u2022\t Wakes you up when you\u2019re in light sleep (using your device\u2019s accelerometer)\n\u2022 \tReminds you to go to bed at any time/day you choose\n\u2022\t Set multiple bedtime reminders\n\u2022\t Sleep cycle calculator helps you find best wake-up times or bedtimes\n\u2022\t Sleep latency (set how long it takes you to fall asleep) \n\u2022\t Sleep goal (set how long you usually sleep)\n\u2022\t Inspirational & motivational quotes to help you get out of bed\n\u2022\t A share button to let you share the quote with the world\n\u2022\t Health app integration\n\u2022\t 15 awesome built-in alarm sounds\n\u2022 \tWake up to a song from your music library\n\u2022 \tUses proximity sensor to turn off display when alarm is set (iPhones only) \n\u2022 \tCustomize snooze length from 0 (off) to 30 minutes\n\u2022\t Customize wake-up window length from 0 (off) to 90 minutes\n\u2022\t Set vibration on or off \n\u2022\t Set your device\u2019s sensitivity to your personal preference \n\u2022\t 5 cool themes to choose from\n\u2022 \tAdaptive UI (made for all iPhones)\n\u2022 \tProgressive volume: the alarm sound will start low then gradually increase until it reaches max (from low to high) to wake you up smoothly! \n\u2022\t Fixed volume: the alarm volume won\u2019t change when it sounds\n\u2022\t Very elegant and simple interface", "artistId": 595926447, "artistName": "Aperture Mobile", "genres": ["Medical", "Health & Fitness"], "price": 0.0, "bundleId": "com.aperturemobile.sleepytimezzz", "formattedPrice": "Free", "averageUserRating": 3.5, "userRatingCount": 21, "searchString": "Sleep Cycle alarm clock"}
