If you are not sure which skill to select, shake the iPhone or iPod and one will be randomly chosen.\n \nAfter following the instructions for the calming activity, you will select one of ten ways to change your thoughts, or shake the device for a random selection.  Changing your thoughts in order to change your feelings is the basis of cognitive behavioral psychotherapy, the most widely practiced form of psychotherapy.  \n \nAfter utilizing one of the thought changers, you proceed to selecting one method for resisting the rituals or compulsions (or again, you may shake the device for a random selection).  This is the basis of exposure and response prevention, the evidence based method of OCD treatment.\n \nAfter implementing those skills, you rate the level of OCD again in order to determine if the skills you chose were effective for you.  If the level of the OCD has not reduced sufficiently, you will be given the opportunity to try again, selecting a different skill set. \n\nThe content presented is for your information only.
