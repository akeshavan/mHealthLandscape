When we train our mind we develop awareness that leads to being kinder, more patient and therefore more compassionate and caring of ourselves and others.  When we\u2019re aware we notice how we feel, we notice what we\u2019re thinking and we notice what we\u2019re doing. So we\u2019re likely to notice when we\u2019re distracted, have better impulse control, be less angry, and be more aware of thought processes with better concentration and memory.  \n\nIf you find yourself wishing that things were different to how they are, or your worry and anxiety habit leads you into fear and perhaps even panic; or you can\u2019t seem to stop the constant flow of thoughts\u2026 or your moods bother you...\n\nThen give \u201cMindfulness Caring for Me\u201d, a try and see what happens for you.", "artistId": 881758229, "artistName": "Frances Kelly", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Education"], "price": 0.0, "bundleId": "com.kelly.mindfulnessCaringforMe", "trackId": 966460349, "trackName": "Mindfulness Caring for Me"}
