Using proven methods and techniques, you will be guided to a better life \u2013 whether it\u2019s about coping with stress, anxiety, depression or training yourself to improve your self esteem and sense of achievement.\n\nMindfit helps users to be aware of their problem areas, and gain insight into what prevents them from changing their situation, in part by becoming aware of how you react when facing a challenge. \n\nWe know from experience that change involves both ups and downs, and Mindfit offers different tools and techniques that can be helpful when challenges arise. \n\nMindfit is designed so that it simulates some of the issues and techniques a therapist would use in his or her first meeting with an individual seeking help.\n\nThe tool is inspired by well-recognized treatments such as cognitive therapy, positive psychology and EMDR, but also by the more general communication and therapy techniques used in psychology.\n\nKEEP TRACK OF YOUR PROGRESS\n\nChange is not just about setting goals for yourself, but also about what you can do to keep motivated to continue.\n\nDuring the process of change habits, it is often easy to forget all the little things you have actually achieved on the way towards your big goal. \n\nResearch shows that being grateful is good for your health, promotes well-being, increases happiness and reduces depression.\n\nThis is one of many reasons why we have developed Mindfit. We recommend that you record the positive events in your life and your feelings of mastery along the way - to reduce stress, anxiety, depression and negative thoughts to keep your mind happy.\n\nOUR CUSTOMERS LIKES US because we helps them to achieve a better everyday life.\n\n*** Feedback\n\"This app is by far the best tracker for you to reflect on when you're not feeling at your best, to show you your worth and boost your confidence day by day. \n\n\"As someone who suffers from anxiety and confidence issues, this app has helped me realise my potential and has great techniques to relax and become more mindful\"\n***\n\nMindfit is suitable for all kinds of people who, in certain situations, or in certain periods of life are: \n\u2022 Feeling stressed\n\u2022 Need motivation and lack energy\n\u2022 People with mild mental distress, such as depression, anxiety, stress and low self-esteem\n\n* A number of psychologists in Norway recommend Mindfit!\n\nTHE PROGRAM is divided into three areas:\n\n1) YOUR INFO\nHere you identify situations, feelings and thoughts so that you become more aware of how you react when facing a challenge. How you choose to see yourself, and your belief that you can learn to cope, will affect the way you react to situations.\n\n2) KEEP TRACK OF EXPERIENCES, THOUGHT RECORDING AND JOURNALING\nShifting your focus to situations that you have mastered will help you address your challenges and helps you to reduce negative thoughts to a greater sense of mastery and positive thoughts about yourself.\n\n3) SELF-HELP TECHNIQUES AND SETTING GOALS\nHere we have collected various techniques (mindfulness, breathing / relaxation exercises and attention training) you can use when you are in a challenging situation. \n\n***** \nMindfit is a self-help app that focuses on mental health training, and the app is intended as a way to help you to help yourself!\n\nWhile the app is a self-help tool, it isn\u2019t a substitute for treatment by a psychologist. The tool is meant to be a guide and a motivator, so that you can more easily follow through on the changes that you have decided to make.\n\nPRIVACY\n\nMindfit does not collect personal information about you as a user of this app. All the information that you record is stored only on your mobile phone.  \n\nRead more at: www.mindfitapp.com", "artistId": 859891994, "artistName": "Mindfit AS", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Lifestyle"], "price": 4.99, "bundleId": "no.mindfit.Mindfit", "averageUserRating": 2.5, "userRatingCount": 13, "searchString": "Mindfit"}
