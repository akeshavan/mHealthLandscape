the iRelease app, you can choose to dissolve your stress and other negative emotions right on the spot, so you\u2019re in charge of your emotions\u2014instead of your emotions being in charge of you!\n\nLive the vibrant, successful life you\u2019ve always wanted by welcoming your natural ability to let go of those debilitating feelings of frustration, anxiety, depression, self-doubt, confusion and more\u2026 And let relaxation, aliveness, creativity, ease and happiness be your everyday experience.\n\nThe simple, gentle process featured in this app is The Sedona Method\u00ae, the world-renowned process for letting go or \u201creleasing\u201d negative emotions developed by Lester Levenson in 1974, further developed by Hale Dwoskin, Sedona Training Associates, and used by hundreds of thousands of people around the world for over 40 years.\n\nAchieve real and lasting results like these:\n\u2022 Enjoy higher self-esteem and self-confidence\n\u2022 Feel calm, centered and focused throughout your day\n\u2022 Stay positive and motivated towards your goals\n\u2022 Experience productive action with greater ease\n\u2022 Unwind naturally and get a good night\u2019s sleep\n\u2022 Have greater peace of mind and an inner sense of well-being\n\nConvenient, easy listening, perfect for rejuvenating breaks throughout your day, the guided meditations are 3 - 6 minutes in length in either male or female voice. They are harmoniously complemented by the beautifully animated lotus Breath Pacer. Breathing in a calm, natural way allows for greater relaxation and focus, and spontaneous effortless release.\n\n\u201cUsing the Sedona Method has transformed my life. Nothing less. I have let go of fear, self-doubt and limiting beliefs, and increased my ability to feel joy, love and peace of mind beyond words.\u201d M. S., Denmark\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to release cravings for certain foods, and am able to fall asleep without the aid of pills.\u201d P. W., Rio de Janeiro\n\n\"I had the great good fortune of \u2018test driving\u2019 this app recently and was astounded by the swiftness of the release and sense of openness and expansion resulting from simply listening to and following a series of simple and clear prompts and inquiries.\n\nWith this app, focus is so easy and effortless.  It is like a laser cutting to the core of the feelings that spontaneously arise. The variety of topics addresses the most common challenges that life brings to distract us from being at peace. The length of the releases make it convenient to excuse oneself from a meeting or situation, as needed; long enough to listen to a track and return to a place of spaciousness allowing for a calmer response or to settle down on-the-spot.\n\nThe beauty of iRelease is its infinite value for experienced releasers and non-releasers alike. As a therapist, I see this app as a readily accessible and effective resource to enhance anyone\u2019s journey to wholeness and freedom.\" Sara Wasserman, MA, LPC, Long Beach, California \n\nTim McCavitt, founder of Sedona Releasing Worldwide, is a Sedona Method Licensed Instructor.
