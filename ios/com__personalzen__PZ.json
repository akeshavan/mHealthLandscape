Built by a team of leading neuroscientists and mobile developers, playing Personal Zen actually retrains your brain to lower stress and anxiety. Just like exercising for physical health, we can exercise our brain for better mental health and wellness!\n \nHere\u2019s what experts in the field of psychology had to say about Personal Zen:\n\u201cPersonal Zen brings cutting-edge research and well-established strategies for reducing anxiety and stress into the palm of your hand\u201d\nShannon M. Bennett, Assistant Professor of Psychology in Psychiatry, Weill Cornell Medical College\n \n\"Instantly engaging for adults and kids, Personal Zen is a rare example of science turned into fun in order to reduce stress and anxiety\" \nDr. Tony Simon, Professor of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, University of California Davis\n  \n***LOWER YOUR OVERALL STRESS LEVEL***\nTo lower your overall stress level our research shows that you should play a few times a week, for around 5-10 minutes at a time. Playing more (up to 40 minutes a week) has been shown to have powerful stress-reduction effects, and playing less, even for only a few minutes, can still boost your well-being. A small time investment can lead to big stress-reduction pay-offs over time.\n\n***DE-STRESS WHEN YOU NEED IT MOST***\nUse Personal Zen to lower stress before or during any stressful situation. \n\nHOW DO I USE PERSONAL ZEN?\nTo use Personal Zen look for the path the friendly sprite leaves after it burrows down out of sight. Then, simply trace the path of the friendly sprite quickly and smoothly. Try to be accurate, swiping every part of the path. Don't let the angry sprite divert your focus from quickly shifting your attention towards the friendly sprite and tracing the path. Don't get frustrated if you miss some, as the healing mechanics of the application will work no matter how fast you do it.  \n\nHOW DOES PERSONAL ZEN WORK?\nWhen we get anxious or stressed, we pay too much attention to the negatives and have less ability to see the positives in life. These habits of attention reduce our ability to cope effectively with stress and can create a vicious cycle of anxiety. Personal Zen helps to short-circuit these habits and frees you up to develop a more flexible and positive focus. Following the friendly sprite actually trains your brain to disengage from the negative and focus on the positive, creating a mindset that helps you overcome stress in the real world. You can reduce your stress and anxiety in as little as one sitting, and the more you play, the more you strengthen well-being and vaccinate yourself against the negative effects of stress.", "artistId": 689013550, "artistName": "Hadley Harris", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Medical"], "price": 0.0, "bundleId": "com.personalzen.PZ", "releaseNotes": "Push Notification improvements and bug fixes", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled": true, "releaseDate": "2013-08-21T16:57:56Z", "averageUserRating": 3.0, "userRatingCount": 97}
