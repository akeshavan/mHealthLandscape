Looking to relieve your OCD symptoms? Wish to feel better, have more confidence and enjoy improved well being? Want to expand your mind and make it more adaptive?\n\nRELIEVING OBSESSIVE THINKING IS SIMPLE\nThrow away negative thoughts. Approach positive ones. Learn to identify your inner self talk and respond quickly. Train daily and improve your wellness.\n\nSCIENCE BACKED\nNew findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG apps.\nAccording to CBT models, negative self talk \u2013 individuals\u2019 ongoing interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as low self esteem, mood, obsessive, OCD and maladaptive thinking. \n\nHOW DO I RELIEVE MY OCD?\nThe foundations of a healthy mind are built upon flexible beliefs. Our beliefs have the potential to bias and affect our ability to deal with daily situations. For example, if I believe that \"everything in my life needs to be prefect\", I won't be able to live up to these expectations and my confidence will decrease.\n\nHOW GG WORKS\nThe application is designed to:\n1. Increase your awareness of negative thoughts.\n2. Train you to identify and challenge negative thoughts.\n3. Increase your access to neutral and positive thoughts.\n4. Increase the automaticity of the above processes.\n5. Provide daily mood and self esteem boost.\n\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\n1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool.\n2. It helps in maintaining healthy thinking during or after therapy.\n3. It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and more. \n\nSTATEMENTS (OR THOUGHTS)\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\nThe longer we exercise and make it a habit, the more automatic this process becomes.\n\nLEVELS AND TOPICS\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 40 levels. Each level has a pool of self talk statements (or thoughts).\n\nThe topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, sin, harm, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, seeing the beauty in the world, fear of abandonment, fear of contamination and more.\n\nYou can also test yourself to see how well you progress with our self assessment tool.\n\nTraining using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious obsessive cycle.\n---\nIN-APP PURCHASE INFORMATION\n\nThe app includes 15 free levels for training on some of the basic topics.
