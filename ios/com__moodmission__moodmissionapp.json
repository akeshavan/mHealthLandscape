Missions are activities and mental health strategies that are quick, easily achievable, and backed up by scientific evidence.\n\nMoodMission is based in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which is an evidence-based psychological therapy for anxiety and depression. Anyone can use MoodMission, whether you just want a lift in your day or need a bit more help recovering from anxiety or depression.\n\nCompleting Missions earns you rewards in the app, motivating you to take steps towards becoming healthier, happier, and more confident. Plus a mission log helps you track your progress over time.\n\nMoodMission learns which types of Missions work best for you, so the more you use MoodMission the better it gets at tailoring your Mission suggestions.\n\nMoodMission is not a replacement for professional help. If you are experiencing anxiety, depression, or any mental health issue, talk to your GP or contact a psychologist for support.", "artistId": 1140332762, "artistName": "MoodMission Ptd Ltd", "genres": ["Health & Fitness"], "price": 0.0, "bundleId": "com.moodmission.moodmissionapp", "userRatingCount": 9, "averageUserRating": 4.0}
