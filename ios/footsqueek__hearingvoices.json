This is recognised as a highly stigmatising experience.\n\nThe Hearing Voices a Guide to understanding helping and empowering individuals app offers support to address this issue; meeting the need for accessible, professional education in the health and social care sector.\n\nA central feature of the app simulates the experience of hearing voices to provide a deeper insight, empathy and understanding. Users are engaged in a number of cognitive and social tasks while listening to recordings created by people who actually hear voices. \n\nThe sense of reality is enhanced by the mobility of the app as learners can carry out simulation exercises in any environment. \n\nPodcasts of people who hear voices are also included allowing a number of stories to be heard. \n\nSupporting text, reflective prompts and interactive exercises are used to enhance the learning experience.", "artistId": 549012000, "artistName": "Footsqueek", "genres": ["Education"], "price": 0.0, "minimumOsVersion": "7.1", "bundleId": "footsqueek.hearingvoices", "primaryGenreName": "Education", "searchString": "Hearing Voices"}
