The new version works smoothly. This app is top quality throughout.\" - Gates of Eden\n\n\"One of the best apps i own. - Has helped me greatly in times I needed to de-stress, relax while crocheting, and even with my anxiety. This is my go-to app when I'm feeling the tension or I just want a few minutes to relax and gather myself.\" - DoctorMom77\n\n\"Guided Mind is a great app for guided meditation, whether you're a 'pro' or just getting started. The user interface is clean and easy to navigate and the app runs smooth as butter. It's also great that you can pick and choose which topics you want for incredibly low prices (these same GM Topics can cost anywhere from $5-$20 anywhere else). It's a great deal.\" - syntheticvoid\n\n\"Very helpful - By far and away the best guided imagery app I have found. With a vast range of in app purchases, there is something for everyone. This app is helping me through a tough time in my life and I appreciate this so much. Thanks to the developers.\" - GubTrain\n\n\n\n\nMore topics are added frequently.
