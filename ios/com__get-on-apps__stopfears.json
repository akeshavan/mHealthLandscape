OVERCOME FEAR AND ANXIETY BY HYPNOSIS\n\n- Overcome your fears and anxieties\n- Regain control over your thoughts and feelings\n- At last, enjoy your life to the fullest\n\nOur native fear programming ensures that we can quickly decide what to do when confronted with danger, just to survive, for example, if we are attacked by a dangerous animal or its contemporary equivalent. So far, so good. However, many people experience fear, even when there is no real danger.\n\nTwo out of every five people in Germany regularly experience minor anxieties; one in ten is so severely limited by fear or anxiety that it is impossible for them to lead a \"\"normal\"\" life. Heart palpitations, trembling, tension, and difficulty with concentration are symptoms which are typically associated with anxiety. Some people suffer from such strong anxieties that they cannot even leave home and therefore become more and more isolated over time. This is beginning of a painfully vicious cycle.\n\nEvery fear is fixed deep within our subconscious and is increasingly reinforced by anxiety-laden behavior. The \"\"anti-anxiety\"\" hypnosis \"\"Stop Fears! Overcome Fear and Anxiety by Hypnosis\"\" can help you reduce or even completely dispel your fears and anxieties. Little by little, you will learn a new way to interpret situations that you have, until recently, viewed and experienced as threatening. This will allow your previous feelings of anxiety to give way to a relaxed, quiet and confident state of mind. In this way, you can let go of the avoidance strategies that you have been using up to now. You will also notice an inner sense of security and internalize the belief that you have everything under control, completely without fear or anxiety.\n\nHOW THE PROGRAM WORKS\n\n\"\"Stop Fears! Overcome Fear and Anxiety by Hypnosis\"\" is an effective relaxation training that utilizes classic hypnosis and mental coaching techniques. The 25-minute program is aimed at adults and young adults who suffer from recurrent or persistent fears that prevent them from living the life they dream of. Kim Fleckenstein specifically targets the power of your subconscious mind in hypnosis. A special affirmation helps you to relax and regain control of your thoughts and feelings so that, over time, it can succeed in helping you let go of your past fears and ultimately get back to a feeling of inner peace and freedom.\n\nWHAT YOU GET\n\n* A highly effective 25-Minute professional Hypnosis session using the latest hypnotic and relaxation techniques \u2013 suitable for both, beginners and more experienced users.\n* The professional and warm voice of Cathy Weber, which leads you into a deep state of relaxation and change.\n* A high quality and state of the art recording.\n* Professionally composed background music for every program by CSW Music.\n* Customize your settings and discover other useful features.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n\nPlease do not listen to this program while driving or during activities that require your full attention. The program does not replace consultation with a doctor or any medications which may be required to treat an illness.\n\nHypnosis is basically suitable for all physically and mentally healthy people. If you are undergoing therapeutic treatment, e.g., for depression or psychosis, and/or taking any prescription medications, please consult with your physician before using this program. The program does not replace any treatment for pathological anxiety disorders.\n\nKim Fleckenstein makes no representation of her program with regard to healing. The user assumes full responsibility for the application of the program.\n\nThe optimal effect can be obtained by listening to the program once a day over a period of at least 30 days.\"", "artistId": 495557446, "artistName": "Get on Apps!", "genres": ["Medical", "Health & Fitness"], "price": 1.99, "currency": "USD", "primaryGenreName": "Medical", "releaseDate": "2015-05-10T03:05:35Z", "bundleId": "com.get-on-apps.stopfears", "genreIds": ["6020", "6013"]}
