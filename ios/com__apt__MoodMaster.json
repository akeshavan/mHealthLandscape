MoodMaster apps come from APT, the Association for Psychological Therapies. Over 93,000 mental health professionals have attended APT post qualification training and MoodMaster apps are designed to bring the most relevant and effective information direct to those who want it. \n\nThis app is written by Dr William Davies, a Consultant Clinical Psychologist who has worked with depressed and severely depressed people in a whole range of settings. He is the co-founder of APT, and the author of Overcoming Anger and Irritability as well as numerous courses on depression and anxiety.\n\nThe input is based primarily on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, which is generally accepted as the leading approach in this sphere. For its success it relies upon the person (a) knowing key information and (b) acting on it. This app is designed to help you achieve both of those as quickly and easily as possible.", "artistId": 463445972, "artistName": "MoodMaster", "genres": ["Medical", "Health & Fitness"], "price": 3.99, "bundleId": "com.apt.MoodMaster", "primaryGenreId": 6020, "releaseNotes": "- Improved My Profile section\n\n- New Audio recordings of relaxation instructions. \n\n- New 'Today's Tip' appears every time you open the app. \n\n- New 'First Aid' section for if you want immediate relief.", "currentVersionReleaseDate": "2014-06-12T01:57:49Z", "searchString": "MoodMaster Anti-Depression App"}
