This app provides tools for cutting down or quitting drinking, tools for managing stress symptoms, education about alcohol use and how it relates to PTSD symptoms, and guidance to find professional treatment.\n\nYou can use VetChange alone or in combination with counseling. Please tell your healthcare provider if you are using the app while you are in counseling. The app is not intended to replace professional treatment.\n\nVetChange is based on the VetChange web intervention and is a collaborative effort between VA National Center for PTSD and Boston University.
