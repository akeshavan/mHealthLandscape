I\u2019m going to use \u2018MyHealthFabric\u2019 to kick start my fitness plan and track my progress\u201d \u2013 MyHealthFabric User\n\u201cI have been a Type 1 diabetic since I was one and a half. I control my diabetes with four insulin shots a day. Previously I found it really difficult to remember to take my insulin shots before or after meals. The App is really helpful reminding me when to take my shots. It\u2019s also useful to track my blood sugar before and after exercise. The library access gives me links to websites and direct information instead of having to search through the internet just to find one useful website. IT\u2019S BRILLIANT!\u201d - Becky Cash\n\u201cI\u2019m using \u2018MyHealthFabric\u2019 for inspiration and motivation\u201d \u2013 MyHealthFabric User\n\u201cI\u2019m using \u2018MyHealthFabric\u2019 to help me balance my university commitments with my social life to reduce my stress levels.\u201d \u2013 Jess Palm\n\u201cBeing an Asthmatic I\u2019ve struggled to do high intensity exercise. Other Apps I\u2019ve used give you High Intensity workouts which haven\u2019t worked for me. This App is brilliant because I can create my own fitness regime with a mixture of high and low intensity. I don\u2019t feel I need to take my inhaler as much anymore. Something as simple as this will benefit me for the rest of my life.\u201d \u2013 MyHealthFabric User", "artistId": 1145902112, "artistName": "Health Companion Ltd", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Lifestyle"], "price": 0.0, "bundleId": "com.iosapp.MyHealthFabric"}
