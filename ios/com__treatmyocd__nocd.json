No more carrying paper and pen around, or forgetting therapy because you're busy. If you're looking for an easier way to feel better, try NOCD. \n\nWhat is OCD? \n\nOCD is a common psychiatric disorder that involves repetitive, unwanted thoughts and compulsive behaviors intended to reduce the anxiety caused by those thoughts. Commonly misunderstood as an annoying personality quirk, OCD usually involves intense distress and can become completely debilitating. \n\n_\n\nnOCD, Inc. is not a treatment company, and the NOCD app is not intended as a standalone treatment. Although this app is developed with clinicians to closely resemble established treatment protocols, it is intended to be used in conjunction with a therapist or another medical provider.", "artistId": 1063365446, "artistName": "nOCD LLC", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Medical"], "price": 0.0, "bundleId": "com.treatmyocd.nocd", "releaseNotes": "-Introducing Topics: moderated discussions on specific topics so you can get better information and genuine support without having to wait\n-Improvements to the Home screen make it easier to find what you need", "genreIds": ["6013", "6020"], "averageUserRating": 4.5, "userRatingCount": 72, "searchString": "OCD and Anxiety"}
