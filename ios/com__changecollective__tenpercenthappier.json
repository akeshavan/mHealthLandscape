A cleaner look. Another batch of new meditations. Enjoy :)\n\n\u2022 New Player: A core part of what makes 10% Happier unique is our Courses, which serve up a combo of quick videos that entertain, inspire, or inform and guided meditations that help train your mind. To make our course experience even better, we've redesigned and rebuilt our video + meditation player from the ground-up -- to simplify the overall experience, and keep you in the flow when you get your meditation on.\n\u2022 Cleaner Look: To help you navigate our growing course and meditation catalog, we've made some improvements that tighten up the way the courses look and give you easier ways to find your next meditation.\n\u2022 Weekly New Meditations: we've welcomed two new (incredible) teachers - Diana Winston and Jessica Morey - in the last few weeks, with new meditations for parents & teens, working with thoughts, and learning stability.\n\nAs always, hit us up with any feedback/comments/questions on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or at support@10percenthappier.com.\n\n--\n\nWhile you're here... we've included snippet from a recent edition of our \"Meditation Weekly\" newsletter with Jay Michaelson.\n\n***\nOne of the problems I\u2019ve always had with mindful speech (also known as \u201cguarding the tongue\u201d in my Jewish tradition, and as \u201cright speech\u201d in my Buddhist one) is that refraining from saying what I really feel can feel like repression. And I don\u2019t like repression. It\u2019s not healthy to bottle these feelings inside, I tell myself. If I don\u2019t express them, I\u2019m going to boil over!\n\nBS. All of that verbiage is what meditators call \u201cstory.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s true, maybe it isn\u2019t, but the fact that I can construct some narrative about it is actually pretty irrelevant. Actually, there\u2019s no kettle boiling over, or balloon about to burst. Those are just images and stories that I\u2019m layering on top of what\u2019s happening.\n\nAlternative stories are available. First, there\u2019s a big difference between not expressing your feelings in words, and repressing them. If something someone said is making you angry, fine \u2013 feel the anger. Accept it. Maybe even befriend it. But don\u2019t hand it the microphone. You can fully affirm and acknowledge your fear, hurt, or anger without necessarily broadcasting it in a comment for hundreds of people to read.\n\nSecond, instead of focusing on feelings of restraint, repression, and resentment \u2013 which, you may notice, tends to increase those feelings \u2013 consider turning the attention to the opposite: freedom. Not clicking \u201cpost\u201d is, after all, an expression of your own freedom. I\u2019m not like an animal (or young child) that has to respond according to its conditioning. I\u2019m not a robot either. I\u2019m a person, and I have a degree of freedom in how I respond.\n\nAnd that freedom feels great. Sure, it feels good to express anger; that\u2019s human nature. But it also feels good to rise above it. That, too, is human nature \u2013 an expression of the best we have to offer as a species, in contrast to the dirty, nasty politics that\u2019s so widespread today.\n\nIt takes some practice to appreciate the flavor of freedom. It\u2019s more subtle than the rawness of revenge, and takes some getting used to. And again, I\u2019m far, far, far from perfect in this regard.\n\nBut mindfulness is a capacity of mind that can be directed, as you gain facility with it, and turning it toward the feelings of freedom in online silence, rather than the feelings of restraint, is immensely rewarding. Really, it feels terrific. And it\u2019s saved me a ton of unnecessary suffering.\n\nPractice mindfulness in meditation, and apply it online. See if it works for you. And let us know how it goes \u2013 that is, if you check in and it feels good to do so!\n***\n\nFor the rest of this edition, or to sign up for the newsletter (for free) visit: https://www.10percenthappier.com/meditationweeklyblog/tech-sanity-part-two-mindful-speech-online", "userRatingCount": 28012, "averageUserRating": 5.0, "searchString": "Happier"}
