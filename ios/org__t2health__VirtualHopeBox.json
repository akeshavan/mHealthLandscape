The VHB contains simple tools to help patients with coping, relaxation, distraction, and positive thinking.  Patients and providers can work together to personalize the VHB content on the patient's own smartphone according to the patient's specific needs.  The patient can then use the VHB away from clinic, continuing to add or change content as needed.\n\nPatients can use the VHB to store a variety of rich multimedia content that they find personally supportive in times of need.  For example, a patient can include family photos, videos and recorded messages from loved ones, inspirational quotes, music they find especially soothing, reminders of previous successes, positive life experiences and future aspirations, and affirmations of their worth in their VHB.  A patient can also collaborate with their provider to create coping cards to use in response to personal problem areas they experience.  Finally, the VHB provides the patient with positive activity planning, distraction tools, and interactive relaxation exercises including guided imagery, controlled breathing and muscle relaxation.", "artistId": 499648345, "artistName": "National Center for Telehealth & Technology", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Education"], "price": 0.0, "bundleId": "org.t2health.VirtualHopeBox", "sellerName": "National Center for Telehealth & Technology", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled": true, "averageUserRating": 4.5, "userRatingCount": 221, "searchString": "Virtual Hope Box"}
