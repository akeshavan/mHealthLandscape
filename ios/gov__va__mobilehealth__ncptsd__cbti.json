It provides a structured program that teaches strategies proven to improve sleep and help alleviate symptoms of insomnia.\n\nCBT-i Coach is intended to augment face-to-face care with a healthcare professional. It can be used on its own, but it is not intended to replace therapy for those who need it.\n\nCBT-i Coach is based on the therapy manual, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia in Veterans, by Rachel Manber, Ph.D., Leah Friedman, Ph.D., Colleen Carney, Ph.D., Jack Edinger, Ph.D., Dana Epstein, Ph.D., Patricia Haynes, Ph.D., Wilfred Pigeon, Ph.D. and Allison Siebern, Ph.D.  CBT-i has been shown to be efficacious for insomnia for both Veterans and civilians.\n\nCBT-i Coach was a collaborative effort between VA\u2019s National Center for PTSD, Stanford School of Medicine, and DoD\u2019s National Center for Telehealth and Technology.", "artistId": 430646305, "artistName": "US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Medical"], "price": 0.0, "bundleId": "gov.va.mobilehealth.ncptsd.cbti", "primaryGenreName": "Health & Fitness", "releaseDate": "2013-06-05T22:58:30Z", "averageUserRating": 3.5, "userRatingCount": 47}
