But when it becomes excessive, persistent and starts interfering with our daily function, well being or quality of life it is time to nix it.\n\nWhile there many options available to treat phobias, therapists often consider Systematic Desensitization, a form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), as a first line of treatment. It is a form of exposure therapy where a person is encouraged to face the fear gradually in a controlled setting paired with coping skills (relaxation techniques) such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation under a therapist\u2019s guidance.\n\nFear Nix app provides a journaling interface to log your experiences of facing the fear gradually based on a fear ladder (hierarchy) in different exposure settings & coping skills. For example you could start with the imaginary setting, pair it with deep breathing, log how you feel and your fear response - fight, flight or freeze in the app. \n\nBased on the data entered over a series of such exposures, Fear Nix app displays visually appealing statistics to analyze and find out what helps facing your fear. With Fear Nix app you can log & track multiple phobias, create your own strategies, hierarchies and coping skills - all neatly categorized in an elegant interface. You can also export the journal and the statistics in pdf format to share it with your therapist. \n\nFear Nix offers more:\n- Passcode protection\n- Backup / restore using iCloud sync\n- 15 beautiful color themes\n- 72 different fonts\n- Preferred start day of week\n- Daily or specific reminders\n- Inspirational quotes\n- Customized icon and colors for fear response\n- Advanced search filters\n- Work offline, no internet connection is required except during iCloud sync\n\nHow to use the app:\n1.
