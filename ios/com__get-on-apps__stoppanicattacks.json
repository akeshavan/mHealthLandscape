OVERCOME PANIC ATTACKS BY HYPNOSIS\n\n- Live your life free from anxiety and panic attacks once again\n- Regain control over your body\n- Learn to be calm and relaxed\n\n\"\"Don't panic!\"\" - this is so easy for many people to say, but for those who suffer from panic attacks and panic disorders, it is almost impossible. If you have ever experienced a panic attack, then you know only too well that in these moments, nothing works. Whether it is a matter of breathing difficulties, heart palpitations, breaking out in a cold sweat, temporary paralysis or the sudden feeling that you are dying, a panic attack is pure stress for the body.\n\nSuddenly, traveling by car, bus or elevator is out of the question. You are unable to cross a large, open space; you suddenly feel an inexplicable fear. It is as if your very being, as well as your body, has suddenly gone out of your control, and you don't know why. And out of fear of the next attack, you limit yourself more and more. A vicious cycle begins.\n\nThe \"\"anti-panic\"\" hypnosis \"\"Stop Panic Attacks! Overcome Panic Attacks by Hypnosis\"\" can help you come to grips with panic and anxiety attacks. Using this program, you can dispel the \"\"fear of fear,\"\" so that you can go back to living a relaxed and serene lifestyle.\n\nHOW THE PROGRAM WORKS\n\n\"\"Stop Panic Attacks! Overcome Panic Attacks by Hypnosis\"\" is an effective relaxation training that utilizes classic hypnosis and mental coaching techniques. This 31-minute program is aimed at people who suffer from panic attacks and panic disorders. With the support of your subconscious mind, Kim Fleckenstein brings you to a safe, mental space where you can face your panic for the last time. You will change the appearance of panic in such a way that you can resolve it to a greater and greater extent. Little by little, you will develop a deep-seated trust that these sudden attacks coming \"\"out of nowhere\"\" will no longer have a chance with you.\n\nABOUT KIM FLECKENSTEIN\n\nThe program was designed by well-known German Hypnotherapist Kim Fleckenstein.
