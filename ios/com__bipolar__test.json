People with bipolar disorder experience high and low moods (mania and depression, respectively) that are more extreme than what people typically experience. This can lead to a lot of stress and problems with family, work, money, and the law. This app contains a self-report questionnaire to help screen for symptoms related to bipolar disorder. It also contains information to help you get a better understanding of this mental illness.\n\nBipolar Disorder Test is designed to evaluate your symptoms of bipolar disorder with a scientifically-supported 15-question test. It uses the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ), a screening questionnaire for bipolar spectrum disorder that is commonly used in research and healthcare settings.\n\nBipolar Test contains four tools:\n- Start Test: take the MDQ questionnaire to screen for bipolar disorder\n- Result: understand your test results and get resources tailored to your result\n- Information: learn about bipolar spectrum disorder and discover additional resources that can help you on your path to recovery\n\nDisclaimer: The MDQ is NOT a diagnostic test. A diagnosis can only be provided by a qualified healthcare professional. Please consult a physician or mental health professional if you are concerned about bipolar disorder.\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nHirschfeld, R. M., Williams, J. B., Spitzer, R. L., Calabrese, J.
