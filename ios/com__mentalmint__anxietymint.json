The aim of the game is to tap the positive image as quickly as possible. In this way, CBM helps train your brain to automatically focus more on positive information in your everyday life.The result: less stress and a happier you.\n\nYou can delete, edit or add your own images to the bias modification program. Add pictures of things you are grateful for, happy events and people that are special to you and give them a positive charge. These will also help to trigger the release of \u2018feel-good\u2019 chemicals during each training session.\n\n\n\u2022 HAPPY NOTES\nSlides will appear during the cognitive bias modification session. These are loaded with bite-sized tips, facts, stats, techniques and exercises to help boost your mood. You can take your time reading the slides and carrying out the exercises as the timer will stop while they are on screen. \n\nGo to Settings to edit and add your own happy notes to the program.\n\n\u2022 POSITIVE WORD SEARCH\n\nJust as focusing your attention on negative or threatening information can trigger the release of stress chemicals like cortisol and adrenaline, so focusing on positive information can trigger the release of \u2018feel-good\u2019 chemicals like serotonin, oxytocin and endorphins.The word search is designed to trigger these \u2018feel-good\u2019 chemicals by getting you to focus on positive words. You need to find all 4 of the words listed below the letter grid to complete the word search.Drag your finger over the letters in the grid to highlight each of the words listed.\n\nTo maximise the positive effect, try to think of all the positive things you associate with each word as you search for it.\n\n\u2022 BREATHING EXERCISE\n\nThere is a guided breathing exercise at the end of each training session. Focusing on your breathing helps to ground you in the present, and triggers the parasympathetic (\u2018rest and digest\u2019) response, instantly making you feel calmer.", "artistId": 601884093, "artistName": "Jason Pegg", "genres": ["Health & Fitness"], "price": 2.99, "bundleId": "com.mentalmint.anxietymint", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled": true, "averageUserRating": 4.5, "userRatingCount": 48}
