As you dig down, the worm will follow until you can guide him to the bottom before time runs out. You need to be able to make words quickly (although a no-timer mode is available) to string together bonuses, as well as just to clear the path.\n\nIf you find the worm to be stuck and you can't come up with any words, you can use a bomb to clear some of the tiles. You have a limited number of bombs, but you can earn more as you make more words. As the worm moves down the board, more letters become available.\n\nEach level has at least 1 hidden gem, and if you can find all the gems in all the levels of a world, a bonus level is opened where you can really rack up the points!\n\nThe bigger the words that you can make the more points you'll earn. Try and make enough points each level to earn all three stars.\n\nWord Wow will sharpen your brain as well as your reflexes.    Help a worm out! \n\nFeatures: \n* 140,000 word dictionary \n* Fast action with the timer or relaxed mode without it\n* More than 240 Levels and 12 distinct worlds \n* Bonus level for each world when  you collect all the gems\n* Lots of replay value as you see your ranking against all other players globally", "artistId": 602002945, "artistName": "DonkeySoft Inc.", "genres": ["Games", "Word", "Entertainment", "Puzzle"], "price": 0.0, "minimumOsVersion": "8.0", "bundleId": "com.donkeysoft.wordwow", "currentVersionReleaseDate": "2018-11-28T19:11:01Z", "userRatingCount": 4288, "averageUserRating": 4.5, "searchString": "Stress Quiz"}
