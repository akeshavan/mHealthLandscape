Join Aegir as he scrambles to repair his boat after a violent chase, and gets ready to begin the journey back to Asgard to put on the party to end all parties.\n\nFlowy is a uniquely designed game controlled by your breath. It uses the science of breathing to calm you down!  In trials Flowy produced measurable decreases in anxiety and panic symptoms. After 90 seconds of play, you will feel relaxed and more centred, ready to take on the trials and tribulations of everyday life.  \n\n\u201cSince first using Flowy I have been feeling a lot better...I am a lot happier having this game with me, it sometimes feels like a secret weapon!\u201d\n\nRemember - The UK National Health Service(NHS) recommends regulated breathing 3-4 times per day for 2-3 minutes each! \n(http://www.cpft.nhs.uk/Downloads/DVD-Documents/Leaflets/Coping%20with%20Panic%20revised%20Jan%202011.pdf)\n\nJoin us to learn how to breath better with Flowy - more content coming soon!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe take evidence seriously!\n\nWe completed our first unblinded, web-based, parallel-group randomized controlled pilot trial with 63 participants in collaboration with the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine in August 2014, where we compared an intervention group playing Flowy with a waitlist control group. \n\nAfter a 4-week period of use, Flowy produced measurable decreases in anxiety, panic and hyperventilation symptoms, and significantly increased quality of life.\n\nFlowy engaged its users throughout the trial duration, with 84% of participants who were given access to Flowy proactively using it. Flowy was accepted as an intervention by study participants, who found the game to be useful, easy to use, easy to learn, and recommendable to friends.\n\n\n-------- \n\nQuotes from users:\n\n\u201cI want to thank you for what you and the Flowy team are doing. The game has helped me on more than one occasion to prevent a big panic attack.\u201d\n\u201cThank you for letting me be involved in this. I think it's such an amazing idea and there is nothing else like this around. I feel like panic attacks are swept under the rug; it feels amazing that someone is finally addressing it. Once the app is ready, I will be promoting it to everyone I know who has anxiety!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cI just wanted to stress how important I think the application (and moreover the approach) could be in helping people like myself deal with anxiety. For me - it\u2019s changed my life completely - and I know this is a story you must hear over and over again.\u201d\n\n\u201cBreathing techniques have been really helpful to me as a coping mechanism in general; I particularly like so-called 7-11 breathing. However, I found that after a while, my brain was still able to dwell or obsess over a negative thought even while I was concentrating on my breathing. Flowy helps with that because it engages me more fully, making it harder for me to dwell on negative thoughts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI of course can't whip out my phone and start playing a game every time I am faced with a difficult situation. However, Flowy has helped me to learn how to control my breathing and make myself more relaxed. This was a skill I could then employ just sitting at my desk. When a difficult situations arose I learnt to slow down and moderate my reaction to negative stimuli.\u201d", "artistId": 582980676, "artistName": "Playlab London", "genres": ["Games", "Health & Fitness"], "price": 0.0, "bundleId": "com.playlab.flowy", "averageUserRating": 3.5, "userRatingCount": 35, "searchString": "Flowy"}
