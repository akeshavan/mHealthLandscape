The app will guide you through the exercises assigned by your therapist and allows you to track and record your progress. In addition, the app provides techniques such as controlled breathing that will help you tolerate and decrease your distress. PE Coach will help you remember and track your upcoming therapy sessions. You will be able to audio record your sessions directly onto your phone so you can review them later as part of your treatment.\n\nBy itself this app is not sufficient to treat PTSD. However, those who are receiving PE treatment can work together with their therapist to use the tools in this app.\n\nPE Coach was created by VA\u2019s National Center for PTSD.", "artistId": 430646305, "artistName": "US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Medical"], "price": 0.0, "bundleId": "gov.va.mobilehealth.ncptsd.pecoach", "releaseDate": "2017-09-14T16:45:19Z", "averageUserRating": 2.5, "userRatingCount": 6, "searchString": "PE Coach 2"}
