It's a real life saver... literally!\"\n\"I'm so glad to see someone help people who does DBT. VERY VERY good app.\"\n\nDialectical Behavior Therapy Skills are a must, not just for people who have BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder), but for just about anyone living in this world alongside others.\n\nAre they necessary skills? No. Could anyone benefit from them? Yes.\n\nDBT Skills Groups are booked out weeks and often times months in advance. This means that if you want to get in one, you may be waiting for a long long time, especially if NOW is when you need help.\n\nDBT Skills Groups focus on SKILLS. This means that practicing the skills is much more important than anything else. And luckily, once you learn the skills, you will retain them for the rest of your life!\n\nIf you are practicing DBT Skills and want a Diary Card, this app is great for you since it has the following:\n\u2022 A Calendar to add a Daily Diary Card with 28 DBT skills.\n\u2022 Descriptions of each skill if you forget\n\u2022 Examples of each skill\n\u2022 Statistical information based on 1 day, 7 days, 28 days, or ALL records. That way if you are in a weekly DBT class, you can easily see which skills you have been focusing on, and which you have been missing.\n\u2022 A Notification reminder that you can set to remind you daily at a specific time to do your DBT Skills Diary Card.\n\u2022 Beautiful photos and artwork along with a backdrop that changes based on what season we are in (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring).\n\u2022 Add your own music to the DBT Skills Diary Card to make the experience more enjoyable.\n\u2022 Full Version Users: You can now send PDF files with your diary card stats + notes via email, or print to your AirPrint printer straight from within the app. Email your therapist/counselor with just a few taps in an easy to read and print format!\n\u2022 As part of our series of DBT apps, your progress will be saved between apps as well, so you'll have access to all your data no matter which DBT app you are in.\n\u2022 Earn Messages Stickers as you progress. Send them to friends via a text!\n\u2022 Unlock more than 1 type of Diary Card so you can continue doing your daily card in a format that fits your lifestyle!\n\u2022 Want to track extra information? Though DBT classes don't require it, you can add custom tracking data for each Daily Diary Card entry. Of course, since this is optional, you simply need to toggle it on to start tracking right away.\n    a) Track Anxiety and Depression using a modified K10 test.\n    b) Track Target Behaviors and your response to them.\n\nThis is the most enjoyable DBT Skills Diary Card in the App Store!

Thanks Robyn!\n\u2022 Improved Bug Reporting to include more more basic information about your device, iOS version, etc...\n\u2022 Fixed the 'Bug Reports' module so it'll move out of the way of the keyboard in most cases and removed the occasional crash.\n\u2022 Added 2 new optional Daily Diary Card features. By default, they are off as they are not directly part of doing a Diary Card. But for those who do want to keep track of extra data, you can now keep track of your Target Behavior as well as Anxiety and Depression levels. Whether this is for yourself, or for a mental health counselor, you'll have the option of adding this to your daily routine.", "primaryGenreName": "Health & Fitness", "releaseDate": "2013-07-16T01:08:45Z", "averageUserRating": 4.0, "userRatingCount": 122, "searchString": "DBT Diary Card & Skills Coach"}
