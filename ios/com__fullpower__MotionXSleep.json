Sleeptracker\u00ae 24/7 uses proven Cognitive Behavioral Science to help you wake up more refreshed. \n\n\u25b6 The leading sleep monitoring app for the iPhone since 2012\n\n\u25b6 Sleeptracker\u00ae patented technology has been featured in The New York Times, ABC News, Dr. Phil and many more\n\n\u25b6 The Intelligent Alarm Clock wakes you up at the optimal time while you\u2019re in a light sleep phase so that you wake up refreshed\n\n\u25b6 In-depth Sleep Analysis, Snoring, Sleep Apnea:\n\u2022 Within 90% accuracy of professional sleep monitors used in sleep clinics\n\u2022 Records snore sounds, sleep apnea, and sleep talking during the night\n\u2022 Delivers the most comprehensive sleep solution for the iPhone\n\n\u25b6 24 white noise sound options to help you fall asleep\n\n\u25b6 Monitor Heart Rate, Activity, and much more:\n\u2022 Measure your resting heart rate in less than 10 seconds using your iPhone\u2019s camera\n\u2022 Monitor your daily activity level: steps, aerobic steps, active time, and calories\n\u2022 Track your body weight\n\u2022 Track trends and correlations in sleep, resting heart rate, weight and activity\n\n\u25b6 Apple Health integration: Share your Sleeptracker\u00ae 24/7 sleep, heart rate, and activity data to the Apple Health app.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen analyzing your sleep, please ensure you place your iPhone according to the instructions, either in bed or in an armband, so Sleeptracker\u00ae 24/7 can accurately monitor your sleep and wake you at the optimal time. Please see the in-app guidance for placement tips.\n\nNOTE: Placing your iPhone on a solid surface such as the floor or a table while recording sleep causes Sleeptracker\u00ae 24/7 to become highly sensitive to movement. This level of sensitivity is required for users sleeping on a motion-absorbing mattress (such as Beautyrest and Tempur-Pedic). However, with the iPhone on the floor or table, noise from the accelerometer sensor can be registered as sleep cycles, resulting in a random sleep graph and random sleep statistics. \n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nSleeptracker\u00ae is committed to constant improvement. We listen to our users and continuously add the most requested features.
