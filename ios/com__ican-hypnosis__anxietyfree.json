It's helped me tremendously more than anything I've tried and made such a positive improvement in my overall well being. I highly recommend it to anyone suffering from stress, anxiety and panic attacks. It works!\n\n\nAnxiety, tension and stress are common in everyday modern life, and as well as a source of unhappiness, can lead to other problems. Stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol signal the body to a state of arousal to meet survival instincts. However, misplaced stressors, can do harm to your long term health; both physical effects such as raised blood pressure, and mental impairments including depression. Anxiety and tension are often unnecessary sources of stress, and give feelings of unease, affect our appetite, and in some cases lead to self medication of recreational drugs. All of which is obviously detrimental to a happy and fulfilling lifestyle. So in order to tackle many of the problems of modern living, it is important to deal firstly with personal wellbeing and happiness. Make it a priority to introduce a balanced and appropriate response to tension, and learn through self-hypnosis some vital strategies to reducing anxiety and all the negative consequences that follow. \nThis App introduces the iCan hypnosis brand to a wider audience by being free of charge, and can be used to learn self-hypnosis for tackling many other problems. We have applications that deal with addiction to nicotine, alcohol, that deal with medical disorders that can be reached through the process of hypnosis. It is a clinical hypnosis method that can directly connect to the subconscious and allieviate and ultimitely allow you to be free from these troubles. \nHypnosis is more than a method of relaxation, and the audio recordings contain subliminal signals that speak to the subconsious with powerful effect. We do not advocate background music, and recommend a quiet and safe environment where you will not be distrubed. The audio lasts for about half an hour, but once you have learned the technique of self hypnosis, you can use the technique for just fifteen minutes, as often as required. Initially, you should use the App about 3 times per week. We kindly ask if you have found benefit from the iCan hypnosis App, please leave a positive review and let others know of your success.", "artistId": 335619213, "artistName": "iCan Hypnosis", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Medical"], "price": 0.0, "bundleId": "com.ican-hypnosis.anxietyfree", "averageUserRating": 4.0, "userRatingCount": 549}
