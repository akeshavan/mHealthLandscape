Through quick and insightful conversations, Youper helps you master life's ups and downs, beat depression and anxiety. \n\nGreat people always have an assistant by their side. Tony Stark has Jarvis, Princess Leia has C3PO, and you have Youper! \n\nOnce a day, Youper asks, \"How are you?\" You respond to this small but powerful question by selecting one of many color-coded moods. Then, Youper builds a conversation around your response with the goal of helping you get to know your mind, improve your mood, and help you overcome stress, and symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n\nCreated by a team of experts led by psychiatrist Dr. Jose Hamilton, Youper utilizes AI (artificial intelligence) to personalize techniques drawn from different psychological therapies, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Meditation, to fit your needs. \n\nOver time, your daily chats with Youper build into a dynamic record of your mind and emotional health. Access the powerful mood tracker and review Youper's colorful charts to understand more about your emotions, improve your behavior, and keep moving forward on the journey of becoming the best version of yourself. \n\nYouper also helps you detect and monitor emotional health symptoms, including anxiety, depression, panic, PTSD, and BPD (borderline personality).\n\nThe integration with Google Fit helps you take control of your mental health and have informed conversations with your doctor, making self-help and self-care easy.\n\nThe Science Behind Youper\n\nYouper is using AI to unlock a new understanding of the human mind and develop more personalized treatments for conditions like depression, anxiety, panic, PTSD and BPD.\n\nThis quest is only possible because we're partnering with thousands of users around the world to understand how emotions, thoughts, and behaviors are connected.\n\nLearn more here http://www.youper.co/science\n\nTestimonials\n\n\"This is so amazing!
