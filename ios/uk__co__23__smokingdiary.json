Over 20 different, evidence-based, techniques to help you become - and stay - smoke free.  See how much money you've saved, how many cigarettes you've not smoked, how long you\u2019ve been smoke free, how much life you've regained and how your health is improving. \n\nLog your cravings, get tips on dealing with them, use the map to see where they congregate, the notes to see what patterns can be identified and the graph to see how they're decreasing. \n\nAll this is free to use and entirely free of ads. If you need extra help giving up smoking our missions could be just what you need, as they\u2019ve been proven to double your chances of quitting. No other app can promise you this.\n\nWe proved the missions worked by performing a rigorous scientific experiment. As far as we know, this is the first ever randomised control trial run entirely within an app. Its success means we want to run many more and our goal is to constantly make our app more effective\n\nThis is all entirely voluntary and you can download the app without taking part in the experiment. Your data will be kept anonymous and you can delete it at any time. But we really hope you do take part because everyone who does will help the quitters who follow. So do yourself a favour by quitting smoking. And do your fellow smokers a favour by helping them understand how it\u2019s done.\n\nWeekly Subscription\nIf you choose to subscribe you get access to all elements of the app. Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the confirmation of purchase  and subscriptions automatically renew each week unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. The subscription costs 99p (or local equivalent) per week. You can manage your subscriptions in the iPhone Settings app and you can turn off auto-renew by going to your Account Settings .Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when you purchases a subscription, where applicable.
