Tracing focuses visual and tactile signals, and allows the brain to decompress. A meditative state occurs quickly as the brain moves from \u201cactive processing\u201d into \u201cmindfulness\u201d.\n\nWhen the brain is mindful it is not in a state of stress. When the brain is mindful, it can manage triggers that cause panic, PTSD, and anger. When the brain is mindful, it can focus away from the signal overload that causes attention meltdown.\n\n-----------\nHow to Use A Mandalynth\n----------- \n\nJust choose a Mandalynth design and trace it with a stylus, a capped pen, or anything that won\u2019t harm your screen. You don\u2019t need to touch the Mandalynth. Just lightly skim the surface of the design.\n\nStart tracing anywhere and finish whenever you like. Tracing a Mandalynth is about following an endless pathway, allowing the mind to center and relax.\n\nOpen Mandalynths are best for managing stress, anxiety, panic and anger because they are very calming to trace.\n\nMedium Mandalynths are best for attention deficit, autism and light mental challenge because they are slightly complex to trace.\n\nTight Mandalynths are best for puzzle solving and mental challenge because they are very complex to trace.\n\nAdd music or soft sounds from the Settings Page to enhance your tracing experience.\n-----------\nUseful Tip\n-----------\n\nSWITCH HANDS WHEN YOU TRACE! It\u2019s easier than you think because the hand does not move when you trace. The shoulder moves the entire arm. Switching hands every so often exercises the mind and promotes neuroplasticity.\nTrace a Mandalynth for as long or a short a time as you wish. There are no rules. Trace for a few minutes to decompress from a stressful moment. Trace for a while to meditate. If you find that time has passed without you noticing it, it\u2019s because your brain needed that time to fully relax.\n\n-----------\nHealth Benefits\n-----------\n\nPeople who use Mandalynths have reported the following benefits:\n\n1)\tLower heart rate and blood pressure\n2)\tPain relief\n3)\tInsomnia relief\n4)\tHeadache and Migraine relief\n5)\tTBI recovery assistance\n6)\tPost-seizure recovery assistance\n\nThese results are anecdotal and not true in every case, but they have been true for many.", "artistId": 1003976677, "artistName": "Erin Rado", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Medical"], "price": 0.0, "bundleId": "net.celticartstore.app", "minimumOsVersion": "8.0", "averageUserRating": 3.5, "userRatingCount": 5}
