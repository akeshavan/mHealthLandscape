This is the story of her visit to the hospital: she will learn all about what happens and even gets to give her stuffed toy an ultrasound.\n\nIn this first, full version, Hetty meets new friends: Priya, Charlie, and Freddie. They each need different imaging techniques, including X-Ray, MRI, and CAT scans. \n\nPriya has a chest infection, Charlie has a broken leg, and Freddie has a concussion. We follow them through the hospital while they are looked after and play games to help you understand what might happen to them. You'll also meet Pete the Porter, Nurse Ethel, and other characters in the hospital that will help the children get better.\n\nAn exciting and engaging way to help children reduce their anxiety when visiting the hospital.\nLearn about: nebulisers, ultrasounds, MRI scanners, and CAT scans. \nGames: Wee in a pot, Scan Dino, Fix Charlie's Leg, Catch the Sick, and more!\n\nLook out for our new stories in 2018, including Diabetes, Oncology/Cancer, Allergies, and Dentistry.\n\nBased on the original idea of Dr Ria Evans and Dr Rebecca Duncombe.
