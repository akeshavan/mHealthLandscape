Want to expand your self-awareness and learn more adaptive thinking?\n\nIMPROVING DEPRESSION IS POSSIBLE\nThrow away your negative thoughts. Accept your positive thoughts. Learn to identify your inner conversation and respond to real life thoughts. Train daily and improve your mood, self-esteem and wellness.\n\nSCIENCE BACKED\nNew findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG apps.\nAccording to CBT models, negative self talk \u2013 individuals\u2019 interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as depression, low self-esteem and maladaptive behaviours. \n\nHOW DO I PREVENT AND BEAT DEPRESSION\nThe foundations of healthy thinking are built upon beliefs. Our beliefs have the potential to bias and affect our ability to deal with daily situations. For example, if I believe that \"everything in myself needs to be prefect\", I won't be able to live up to these expectations and my mood will decrease.\n\nBELIEFS AND SELF-TALK\nBeliefs and self-talk are interrelated. Once we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self-talk, we can change our beliefs and help us get rid of the ones that negatively affect our mood and cause depression.\n\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\n1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool.\n2. It can help reduce depressive symptoms during or after therapy.\n3. It was found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, fears, depression and more. \n\nSTATEMENTS (OR THOUGHTS)\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought maintains negative self-talk, reject it by throwing it away upwards of-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, embrace it by dragging it downwards towards yourself.\nThe more we train, the more automatic this process becomes.\n \nHOW MUCH SHOULD I TRAIN EACH DAY?\nTo feel better and improve your wellbeing, start today! GG Apps are designed to be most effective in short training sessions. You are advised to complete up to 3 levels per day, which should only take between 2-4 minutes.\n\nLEVELS AND TOPICS\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 50 levels. Each level has a pool of self talk statements (or thoughts).\nThe topics include: self-talk, belief in change, hopelessness, self-criticism, negative thinking, coping, being active, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, self blame, danger and threat, fear of abandonment, and more.\n\nTest yourself to see how well your thinking progresses and becomes healthier with our self assessment tool.\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT THE FACTS BEHIND GG APPS\nVisit our website: http://ggapps.net\n\n---\nIN-APP PURCHASE INFORMATION\n\nThe app includes 15 free levels for training on basic topics. 30+ additional levels can be accessed with a purchase.
