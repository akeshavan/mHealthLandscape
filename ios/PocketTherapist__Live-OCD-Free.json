If you are struggling with OCD, ERP should be the foundation of your treatment program as research indicates it will significantly reduce symptoms for 80% who engage in this form of treatment.  For more information on ERP, please consult the International OCD Foundation website at www.OCFoundation.org. \n\nFor adult users, this app will help create exercises to diminish OCD symptoms, set practice goals and rewards to increase motivation and consistency (the keys to success with ERP), provide a multitude of tools to help fight OCD at any given moment (including specific tools for checking compulsions and contamination fears), and allow users (and any professional they may be working with) to track and monitor their progress.  \n\nThe children\u2019s version, while having the same capabilities as the adult version, is game-like and engaging.  Live OCD Free will guide child users through their battle with the Worry Wizard in an effort to reveal his true identity and, most importantly, conquer their OCD.  \n\nLive OCD Free includes both adult and child video tutorials as well as an extensive 30-page user\u2019s guide with invaluable information that will enable users to utilize this program as an effective self-help tool or as an adjunct to therapy with a professional. \n\nThis program may be adapted for use with other OCD spectrum disorders including Body Dysmorphic Disorder, health-related OCD or Hypochondriasis, Tourette Syndrome or other tic disorders, as well as more general fears and phobias.\n\nFor additional support and guidance along the journey to living OCD Free, our newly launched Live OCD Free forum (accessible from our website, www.LiveOCDFree.com) provides ongoing support from OCD experts and other sufferers.  Additionally, expert consultations and ongoing therapy may be provided to those who wish to work with a professional but do not have access to treatment with an OCD specialist in their area.\n\nFor more specific information on Live OCD free's features and functionality, please visit www.LiveOCDFree.com.  Comprehensive video tutorials are accessible from our website.", "artistId": 509337843, "artistName": "Pocket Therapist, LLC", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Medical"], "price": 29.99, "bundleId": "PocketTherapist.Live-OCD-Free", "averageUserRating": 4.0, "userRatingCount": 7, "searchString": "Live OCD Free"}
