To have a full, productive day is difficult if you have trouble sleeping. Sleep deprivation negatively affects every aspect of life: work, love, finances, creativity, relationships, health, and spiritual well-being.\n\nWhether you are unable to get deep rest each night or can\u2019t relax, we\u2019d like to introduce you to Sleep and Relaxation Hypnosis.\n\nMindifi uses advanced hypnosis techniques, along with calming sound effects, music, and beautiful visuals, to create a meaningful and restful experience. \n\nSee what others are saying:\n\n\u201cThis app is the only thing that can get me to sleep on those nights when I just can't seem to stop thinking!\u201d - Abster G.\n\n\u201cI was suffering from insomnia for almost 2 years waking up in the middle of the night or unable to fall asleep etc. Now I lay down and mentally tell my mind the words deep sleep and I'm out like a light. Thank you!\u201d - Matthias B.\n\n\u201cMy little brother is always disturbing me. But when i try this app, and try it on him, he actually fall asleep. So that is why i rate 5 stars for this app is useful. Download this app it\u2019s incredible\u201d - Imam P.\n\n\u201cThis Is The Best App Evar I Made My Mum Fall Asleep So I Could Go To A Party Didn't wake until the morning My Dad Was Shouting At Me So Then I Used It On Him And Dropped On The Floor DEAD SLEEPING!\u201d \n\n\u201cAmazing. My first time it felt strange because I hadn't done anything like this before. 2nd time and every time since I'm ok. I've downloaded almost all of them! They've helped in just about every area I need improvement! Thank you to whoever took the time to make these.\u201d - Hilary C.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a horrible Insomniac with sleep apnea since i was a child-it takes copious amounts of sedatives for me to fall asleep. Due to a major decline in my health i can no longer use sedatives and am now forced to use a Bipap and oxygen machine to sleep with at night. The mask drives me insane and after weeks of broken sleep and no sleep i ran across this app while searching for meditation. I was skeptical but desperate but to my surprise it put me to sleep within 15 mins the first night and ten mins the second!!\u201d Ashley D.\n\n\u201cI recently had an injury that kept me from going to sleep. I would toss and turn trying to find a less painful, more comfortable position that simply was not there. I tried the Sleep Like a Baby session as a last resort and was able to go to sleep without all the pillow punching and log rolls that kept me from sleeping the night before. Once I allowed my mind to let go of outside sounds and turned myself over to the recording, I lost track of the pain and fell asleep. I woke up this morning feeling better than I have in a long time, and I have this app to thank!\u201d - Terrie V.\n\n\u201cI was at the end of my rope - ready to go back to the doctor and try yet another sleeping pill. Until I found this!! It still may take me two 'sessions' to fall asleep, but I find myself actually looking forward to bedtime and my relaxation session. I have a partner that snores something fierce and I no longer want to smother him with his own pillow! The peaceful partner app is worth the price of admission. The only thing you have to lose is a good nights sleep.
