Yes, without correct deep breathing exercises, you could be screwing up your mood, sleep and eating habits! Breathing techniques are more important than what you may think... This is why you need the Deep Breathing Exercises app!\n\nDeep Breathing Exercises is the best app to learn diaphragmatic or pranayama yoga breathing. Included inside it are 4 lung exercises, each one of which with its own timer, animation, explanation and ratio: \n- Normal Breathing (inhale for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds)\n- Square Breathing (inhale/keep in/exhale/keep in again for 4 seconds each)\n- Pranayama Breathing 478 (inhale for 4 seconds, keep in 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds)\n- Yoga Breath (inhale for 5 seconds, keep in for 20 seconds, exhale for 10 seconds)\n\nThe benefits of each of these types of rhythmic breathing include fight social anxiety and improving sleeping patterns, blood circulation and mood. Keep in mind that you have to follow the ratio and timer correctly.\n\nWant to create your own breathing exercises, specifying the length of time for which you will inhale and exhale? The Premium Version of Deep Breathing Exercises will let you do that! Just specify the breathing ration you wish to achieve. Remember that this mode is for experts only (and you can also create exercises with the technique of \u201c1-4-2 Ratio\u201d); refrain from inserting ratios that could be impossible to achieve or that could damage your health.\n\nFinally, get the right music as a background to your breathing exercises. We added a song that you can listed for free, and another 9 songs that can be downloaded with the premium version. That's 10 songs in total! Here are the titles:\n\n1) Relaxation Music\n2) Breath and Relax\n3) Fight Anxiety\n4) Lung Exercises\n5) Diaphragmatic Breathing\n6) Yoga Soundtrack \n7) No More Stress\n8) Meditation Technique\n9) Total Relief\n10) Oxygen \n\nWe hope this app can give you serene and stress relieving moments, and help you coping with anxiety and stress.
