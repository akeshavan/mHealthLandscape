In your pocket. iCouch CBT.\n\niCouch CBT puts the power of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in your pocket! iCouch CBT makes it easy to keep track of your thinking, analyze your emotions and change your outlook.\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy is a type of therapy that helps you solve problems by focusing on changing your thoughts when faced with difficult situations. It's a goal-oriented approach that \"trains\" you to rethink your reactions. You can't change your past, but you can change how you react to now.\n\nThe idea behind CBT is by changing your automatic thoughts to a situation, you can change how you feel. Automatic thoughts are often distorted. For example, you might see everything in black and white or maybe you see only the downsides to a situation. These distortions are what make you feel bad about something. iCouch CBT helps you recognize your thinking patterns and, as they say, knowing is half the battle! With increased awareness, you can begin the process of changing how you react -- eventually minimizing or eliminating the influence of thought-distortions.\n\nIf you suffer from stress, anger, anxiety, depression or bipolar disorders, CBT is a proven tool that can help you feel better, be more productive and improve your outlook. Everyone can benefit from iCouch CBT.\n\niCouch CBT features a clear, step-by-step approach that leads you through the CBT process. Unlike other CBT tools, iCouch CBT allows you to customize how you use the app. You can add your own emotions or distortions, delete the built-in ones and use the text fields however works best for you. It's your app for your life.\n\nYou start by filling out the \"What Happened\" screen. Here you'll describe an upsetting situation. Next you describe your negative thoughts from the situation. You then will add your emotions, rating their intensity. Next, \"Think About It\" and describe what you're thinking. Once you've described your thinking you'll have the chance to evaluate it and select the distortions that may be negatively influencing your feelings. Now, the best part.. After selecting the distortions that are making you feel bad, you'll then have the chance to create a better thought -- one that isn't distorted. You'll then write what you could do next time instead. Finally, you'll Re:Think and come up with your new thought and then you can reevaluate your emotions. At this point, you've had the chance to think it through completely and, almost by magic, you'll be feeling better!\n\nYou can then save the situation to \"My Log,\" email it to yourself, a friend or your therapist. You can also view your situations on any of your iCloud-connected devices. This is an OPTIONAL feature, that you easily disable within the Settings section. iCouch (or Apple) can never see your answers. Your privacy is vitally important!\n\niCouch CBT features:\n\n* Optional password protection with Touch ID that protects your log and answers.\n* Optional iCloud integration\n* Optimized for both iPad and iPhone, retina and non retina screens.\n* A clear, step-by-step process.\n* Help screens for each step.\n* Emailing of your situations\n* Customizable emotions and distortions\n\niCouch CBT never collects any personal information.
