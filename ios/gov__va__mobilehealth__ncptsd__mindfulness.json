Mindfulness has been shown to be effective for reducing stress, improving emotional balance, increasing self-awareness, helping with anxiety and depression, and coping more effectively with chronic pain.\n\nMindfulness Coach 2.0 was developed to help Veterans, Service members, and others learn how to practice mindfulness. The app provides a gradual, self-guided training program designed to help you understand and adopt a simple mindfulness practice. Mindfulness Coach also offers a library of information about mindfulness (for example \u201cWhat is Mindfulness?\u201d, \u201cHow to Anchor Your Attention\u201d), 12 audio-guided mindfulness exercises and a growing catalog of additional exercises available for free download, goal-setting and tracking, a mindfulness mastery assessment to help you track your progress over time, customizable reminders, and access to other support and crisis resources. Mindfulness Coach is free, doesn\u2019t take or share any of your personal information, and doesn\u2019t require add-on purchases.\n\nMindfulness Coach was created by VA\u2019s National Center for PTSD.", "artistId": 430646305, "artistName": "US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Medical"], "price": 0.0, "bundleId": "gov.va.mobilehealth.ncptsd.mindfulness", "minimumOsVersion": "10.0", "genreIds": ["6013", "6020"], "averageUserRating": 4.5, "userRatingCount": 219}
