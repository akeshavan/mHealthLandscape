Whether you\u2019re experiencing symptoms of stress, feeling depressed or having anxiety attacks, Talkspace is the place for you. It\u2019s also great for couples that need a new spark of motivation, to relieve tension and to increase positive feelings in their relationship. We will connect you with a dedicated, licensed therapist for on-demand, private text, audio, and video chat therapy, anywhere and anytime. All in the palm of your hand, on your phone or web browser!\n\nHOW DOES TALKSPACE WORK?\nTalkspace is easy. Anyone can start with a free consultation, so you can chat with a Matching Agent who will answer any questions and ultimately match you with a therapist based on a number of factors. As a Talkspace member, you will have access to your private counselor and secure chat room where you can discuss your life, ask questions and raise troubling issues. Your Talkspace therapist will check in with you based on your agreement with them (usually 1-2 times a day). \n\nTALKSPACE IN THE PRESS\n\u2022 \u201cThe process was identical to what I had experienced in traditional therapy, except that I had access to it anytime I pulled out my iPhone.\u201d \u2013 Wall Street Journal\n\u2022 \u201cRoughly 46 million Americans had a mental illness in 2011 but only 39% sought treatment. Barriers to seeking treatment include the cost, stigma, and time commitment. Talkspace aims to erase those barriers.\u201d \u2013 CNN\n\u2022 \u201cIt\u2019s really like texting. It\u2019s easier to write out my feelings, rather than when you\u2019re sitting in a room with someone and it\u2019s hard to explain things.\u201d \u2013 Mashable\n\u2022 \u201cI spent 7 days with a therapist who only knew me via text message and I might never go back to traditional therapy again.\u201d \u2013 Business Insider\n\u2022 \u201cBy keeping users anonymous, Talkspace hopes to alleviate the stigma that currently prevents 28% of people who need mental health care, but don\u2019t receive treatment, from finding a therapist.\u201d \u2013 The Verge\n\nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST?\nFor only $49 per week (billed monthly), Talkspace members gain unlimited access to a licensed therapist, free from appointments and the inconvenience of traveling or taking time off work. Our pricing plans are 80% lower than the average co-pay for traditional, in-office therapy appointments (which are usually only one hour long and twice a month). \n\nWHO ARE THE THERAPISTS?\nWe have over 1000 licensed therapists in the Talkspace network with thousands of years of combined medical experience! Our counselors\u2019 backgrounds vary, specializing in issues that include: stress and anxiety, depression, LGBTQ issues, domestic violence, PTSD, repression, phobia, work/life issues, chronic illness, and many more. Each Talkspace counselor undergoes an extensive background check to ensure proper qualifications and a proven track record of providing excellent service and guidance. \n\nIS TEXT-THERAPY EFFECTIVE?\nSome studies show that online chat therapy is as effective as traditional therapy. Other research demonstrates that online therapy is sometimes more effective than face-to-face therapy, as text-messaging allows for more immediate care and higher engagement. \n\nIS TALKSPACE SAFE?\nAt Talkspace, your privacy and safety are always our first priority, so you don\u2019t have to worry. We go to great lengths to ensure user data is kept secure and confidential. Our system is encrypted at the highest industry standards (Privacy Policy can be found at https://www.talkspace.com/public/privacy-policy). \n\nCONNECT WITH US\nWe are always happy to connect with users and receive feedback to help improve the app. \n\u2022 Email - support@talkspace.com \n\u2022 Website - Talkspace.com \n\u2022 Twitter - https://twitter.com/Talkspace \n\u2022 Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/Talkspacetherapy", "artistId": 661829389, "artistName": "Groop Internet Platform inc.", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Medical"], "price": 0.0, "currency": "USD", "bundleId": "com.talktala.talktala", "genreIds": ["6013", "6020"], "averageUserRating": 4.0, "userRatingCount": 5953}
