Kate Bayless, LiveStrong.com\u201d\n\n\u201cFor individuals with chronic worry, anticipatory anxiety, and GAD, this app gives a simple self-monitoring and documenting of worry - Lucielle Campanero, HealthAim.com\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is also helpful to share with your Cognitive Behavioral Therapist as this gives him/her the opportunity to review worries throughout the day that sometimes cannot be expressed on a weekly basis - Dr. Liz Matheis, Ph.D. , Anxiety.org\u201d\n\n\u201cTaking in a unique approach to dealing with anxiety, Worry Watch helps sufferers cope with their fears by literally proving things aren\u2019t as bad as they seem - Mario McKellop, WebPsychology.com\u201d\n\n\u201cIt helps you track \u2018what might happen\u2019 vs. \u2018what actually happened\u2019, and has been lauded as a really logical approach to anxiety - Lyndsey Gilpin, TechRepublic.com\u201d\n\nAbout the app:\n\nOften we worry and get anxious about everyday things. Later we realize most of those worries were unnecessary and some irrational too. Yet, we worry again for something else.\n\nWorry Watch app is designed to capture and reflect on those momentary self-realizations. By logging \u2018what might happen\u2019 perception from day one and tracking it to \u2018what did happen\u2019 reality, we may get a deeper understanding of our worry / anxiety patterns. Such an understanding may help us challenge our negative perceptions and change our future thought patterns in a positive way. \n\n\nHow to use the app:\n\n1. Record: Write down what is bothering you and set a reminder to revisit it later.\n2. Reflect: Once past the worry, note whether the outcome was as bad as worried.\n3. Reason: Logically analyze your thought patterns with the help of charts & statistics.\n4. Realize: Based on your own statistics, realize that your worries may be mostly unfounded.\n5. Refute: Help your self by challenging your worry perception when you tend to be anxious again.\n\nBelow are some of the common mind traps / negative thinking habits, also known as cognitive distortions that may cause anxiety, which the app helps to capture:\n\n1.\tAll Or Nothing: Thinking in extremes without considering all the possibilities\n2.\tCompulsive: Thinking in terms of should / must\n3.\tFiltering: Ignoring/Minimizing the positives and focusing only on the negatives\n4.\tFortune Telling: Assuming a negative outcome without considering all the facts\n5.\tLabeling: Judging / jumping to conclusions about self or others\n6.\tMagnifying: Exaggerating  things out of proportion\n7.\tMind Reading: Assuming that others are having negative opinion of self\n8.\tGeneralization: Assuming that if happened once it will happen every time\n9.\tPerfectionist: Unwilling to accept anything less than the best\n10.\tPersonalizing: Taking things personally, blaming self for everything\n\nOther features of the app:\n\n1.\tWith daily & weekly reminders set aside time to clear your mind\n2.\tBackup, restore or delete data using iCloud sync\n3.\tExport data as pdf, text file or comma separated values (CSV) file\n4.\tPrint, message or email the report\n5.\tProtect the journal using a passcode\n6.\tUse calendar as anxiety streaks tracker\n7.\tAdd inspiring quotes\n8.\tFind entries quickly using advanced search filters\n9.\tPersonalize the app with\n- 15 beautiful themes\n- 72 elegant fonts\n- custom contexts, cognitive biases and outcome Icons& colors\n- any day as preferred start day of week\n10.\tWorks offline, no internet connection needed except during first time walk through & during iCloud sync\n\nNote: Worry Watch app is not intended to substitute or replace professional medical advice or treatment of your physician or therapist.
