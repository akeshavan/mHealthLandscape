Based on the principles of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Mood Rocket allows you to rate, log, and write notes about your mood. After you rate your mood, Mood Rocket gives you suggestions (called \u201cMood Boosters\u201d) about how to improve your mood. Mood Rocket will keep track of your mood ratings, your notes, and which Mood Boosters you use. You also have access to a history of your mood ratings and notes that will give you insights into how your mood fluctuates over time. \n\nIf you are in therapy or counseling, Mood Rocket enables you to share your mood ratings with your therapist/counselor. This allows your therapist/counselor to make the most out of a therapy session by going over your mood ratings with you. You can also collaborate with your therapist/counselor on creating custom Mood Boosters for your unique problems. \n\nFeatures include:\n* Rate your mood as often as you want\n* Receive random or scheduled reminders to rate your mood\n* Write notes about how your are feeling each time you rate your mood \n* Select from a list of Mood Boosters to help improve your mood\n* Create your own custom Mood Booster on your own or with your therapist/counselor\n* Rate your mood before and after using a Mood Booster\n* Select specific Mood Boosters as your favorites to see them suggested more often\n* Review mood history to see how your mood changes over time\n* Use mood history reports to see how Mood Boosters affect your mood\n* Share your insights with your therapist/counselor", "artistId": 1203037423, "artistName": "Mood Vitals", "genres": ["Health & Fitness"], "price": 0.0, "primaryGenreName": "Health & Fitness", "releaseDate": "2017-03-10T01:52:02Z", "bundleId": "com.moodvitals.mr", "searchString": "Mood Rocket"}
