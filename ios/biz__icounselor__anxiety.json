If you are not sure which skill to select, shake the iPhone or iPod and one will be randomly chosen.\n\nAfter following the instructions for the calming activity, you will select one of ten ways to change your thoughts (or again, you may shake the device for a random selection). Changing your thoughts in order to change your feelings is the basis of cognitive behavioral psychotherapy, the most widely practiced evidence based form of psychotherapy.   \n\nAfter utilizing one of the thought changers, you proceed to selecting one type of solution for the problem that triggered your anxiety, or shake the device for a random selection.\n\nAfter implementing your solution, you rate your level of anxiety again in order to determine if the skills you chose were effective for you.  If your level of anxiety has not reduced sufficiently, you will be given the opportunity to try again, selecting a different skill set.\n\nThe content presented is for your information only.
