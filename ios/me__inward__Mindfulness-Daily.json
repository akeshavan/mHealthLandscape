I feel like it asks me how I\u2019m doing? How am I feeling? What mood am I in?...The alerts, the reminders, the pauses [let] you be still for a moment. Very highly recommend this app!\u201d \n- Joeykcmo (iTunes review)\n\n\"I am bipolar and anxiety is a constant struggle for me. I started mindfulness a few months ago after my new therapist recommended it & found the breathing exercises helpful but really easy to forget or ignore. \n\nThis app has reminders, guides you through the meditation techniques & the best part is the pause button. When I start feeling tense I just take a little pause and get my breathing under control. Having the images to view while breathing activates more of my mind freeing the anxious thoughts. The reminders can be set for whenever or how often I may need them which helps me return to the moment when I don't even realize I'm tense. \n\nI highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from anxiety or just wants to live a more mindful, present life.\"\n- PookusJ (iTunes review)\n\nFeatured:\n\n- Featured in the iTunes App Store \u201cWhat\u2019s Hot\u201d list in over 20 countries\n- Developed with leading scientists, doctors, researchers, coaches and trainers\n- Recommended by the Daily Mail as a \u201cStress-Busting Smartphone App to Keep You Calm on the Go\u201d\n- Powered by inward inc., which has been mentioned in The NYTimes, Newsweek, and NPR\n\n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Integration with Apple's Health app to track Mindful Minutes\n- Simple Start program: 21 days of free mindfulness audio lessons.

It also happens to be the best designed app in this category I've seen.\u201d -ForgetPerfect (iTunes review)\n\n\u201cWhile I know there are no \u2018quick fixes\u2019 when it comes to kids, this app is as close to one as I've found. I began the lessons to help deal with stress at work, and my 5th grader wanted to know what the audio reminders were about. I explained and know he's doing the lessons with me. They are working wonders on our frustration tolerance during homework and work! As soon as we start to feel that tension build, we remind each other of what we've been learning and practicing, take a moment, and regroup.\u201d -John-546 (iTunes review)", "artistId": 701112451, "artistName": "inward inc", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Lifestyle"], "price": 0.0, "bundleId": "me.inward.Mindfulness-Daily", "averageUserRating": 4.5, "userRatingCount": 6198, "searchString": "Mindfulness Daily"}
