MIT has not endorsed Cardiio-Heart Rate Monitor or Cardiio, Inc. \n\nBlood absorbs light. Every time your heart beats, the blood flow to your face and finger increases, causing more light to be absorbed. In between beats, less light is absorbed. By using your smartphone camera to capture tiny changes in reflected light from either your finger or face, Cardiio can calculate your heart rate. \n\n**IMPORTANT TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS \nFor more info, see http://www.cardiio.com/faq\n\u2022 ALWAYS hold your phone steady, keep still, and don\u2019t talk during a measurement. \n\nFINGER mode:\n\u2022 Make sure your fingers are not cold.\n\u2022 Cover the entire back camera lightly with your finger; Don't press too hard to avoid restricting blood flow to your finger.\n\nFACE mode:\n\u2022 Look straight ahead and hold your phone around 6 inches in front of your face \n\u2022 Be in a well-lit area so your face is well illuminated, but don\u2019t have a bright background behind you (backlit) as it makes your face appear dark in contrast. \n\u2022 Make sure your face is clearly visible (e.g. no long hair covering your forehead etc.) so that it can be easily detected. \n\n\nNEED HELP? If you have difficulty with the app, just contact us: info@cardiio.com \n\n\nWHAT THE PRESS SAY \n\nPC Magazine - \"\u2026 the app is simple, yet beautiful and pretty slick.\" \n\nCult of Mac - \"Cardiio is one of those apps that wows you...\" \n\nLifehacker - \"it\u2019s a little mind-blowing...\" \n\n\nWARNING: NOT FOR MEDICAL USE\nIf knowing your pulse rate is critical to your health, you need to have your pulse taken by a medical professional.
