This means you can deal with worries once a day, rather than carrying them around with you 24/7.\n\nKey features:\n\nDecide on a time, place and length of time to deal with your worries each day.\n\nWhen you notice yourself worrying about something, add it to WorryTime and get on with your day.\n\nUse your WorryTime to review the worries you've added and ditch the ones that no longer matter to you.\n\nProduced in consultation with the Centre for Clinical Interventions, ReachOut WorryTime is based on cognitive behavioural techniques that are used by health and wellbeing practitioners to assist people with anxiety and stress.\n\nManage the symptoms of anxiety, worry and rumination.\n\nDisclaimer: may be used with or without support from a registered health practitioner, but you may wish to consult with your local health or wellbeing practitioner if you are uncertain about using it.", "artistId": 710387022, "artistName": "ReachOut Australia", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Lifestyle"], "price": 0.0, "bundleId": "au.com.reachout.worrytime", "minimumOsVersion": "7.0", "currentVersionReleaseDate": "2015-12-15T21:37:45Z", "genreIds": ["6013", "6012"], "releaseNotes": "In this update we're making it easier for new users to learn about WorryTime, including:\n\n- Guided steps to set time and duration of WorryTime\n- New help tips on the home screen in case you get lost\n- Better timing for help tips showing up\n\nWe've also zapped a couple of bugs where actions were disappearing and animations got stuck.\n\nHow are you using WorryTime?
