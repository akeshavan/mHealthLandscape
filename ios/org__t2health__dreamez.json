Unfortunately for many people the nightmares that go with post-traumatic stress can leave you tired during the day. And feeling sleepy all the time can make it that much harder to recover. Dream EZ is based on the principles of imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT). This therapy can help change nightmares into less disturbing dreams so you can get a better night\u2019s sleep.\n  Imagery Rehearsal Therapy (IRT) is an evidence-based treatment for reducing nightmares. The goal of IRT is to reduce the frequency and intensity of nightmares. By doing so, people also find that their sleep, anxiety, and depression symptoms improve.\n  Although Dream EZ is available to everyone, this app should be used with a health care provider. It is in no way intended to be a therapy replacement tool. Dream EZ should always be used as part of ongoing nightmare reduction therapy. If you are a U.S. military service member, dependent and/or veteran and need help finding a therapist, please call the DCoE Outreach Center at (866) 966-1020\n  This application was created for U.S. service members, their dependents and veterans by the National Center for Telehealth & Technology, a part of the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury and the Defense Health Agency.", "artistId": 499648345, "artistName": "National Center for Telehealth & Technology", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Utilities"], "price": 0.0, "bundleId": "org.t2health.dreamez", "sellerName": "National Center for Telehealth & Technology", "primaryGenreId": 6013, "releaseNotes": "This update is signed with Apple\u2019s latest signing certificate.
