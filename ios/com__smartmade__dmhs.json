It also provides direct link to a 24-hour telephone support C.A.L.L. (Crisis Access Linkage Line), as well as many other community resources. \n\nThis app is an accessible suicide prevention resource, packed full of useful information to help you stay safe. You can use it if you are having thoughts of suicide or if you are concerned about someone else who may be considering suicide.\n\nEveryone seems to be affected by suicide in one way or another.  It could be a family member, friend, colleague, someone close or someone in the community.  It touches all of our lives and can have an impact on others for a lifetime.  Tragically, it is known that many suicides could have been prevented. \nOne of the biggest challenges is getting people to realize just how much suicide is avoidable and can be prevented.  Awareness helps prevent suicide.  It is a subject that needs to be addressed and talked about - that is how lives can be saved.  \n\nInformation, education, resources and supports can help people.  That is why Durham Mental Health Services (DMHS) felt it was important to create a mobile app so that anyone can try to help. There are well known effective measures to help prevent suicide.\n\nThis app has 6 main areas that contain helpful information:\no\tFeeling Suicidal? Think Someone is?\no\tBeing Helpful, What to Say\no\tSafety Plan & Resources\no\tYouth and Young Adults\no\tAdults & Seniors\no\tNeed Support? In Crisis?\n\nWe hope that people will use this app, share this app to help create a caring, supportive community so people can live their lives to the fullest potential.\n\nWe believe that Hope is essential.", "artistId": 1058912200, "artistName": "New Design Group Inc", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Education"], "price": 0.0, "bundleId": "com.smartmade.dmhs"}
